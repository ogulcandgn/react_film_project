                In April 1945, as the Allies make their final push in the
                European Theatre, a battle-hardened Army sergeant named Wardaddy
                commands a Sherman tank and his five-man crew on a deadly
                mission behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, out-gunned, and with a
                rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men
                face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the
                heart of Nazi Germany.
